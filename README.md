# Practice
This repo is meant for general computer science practice

This will be used to make sure my fundamentals don't get rusty, and to provide a baseline to look at different languages.  To start with the master branch will be in C++, and subsequent branches will be in different languages.  This is in known contract to standard repo practices, but since this isn't reflecting any sort of server environment this should be fine... With the exception of testing git best practices.

Practice will largely be monolithic in nature, with a main driver, and should be fed data from a separate inputs file.  In production it is generally a better practice to break out these sort of helper functions into their own files, for more clear reusability and to limit the amount of extra code being injected as a dependency.
